Here are some guidelines for hacking on gcloud-java.


Using maven for build/test
--------------------------
After you cloned the repository use Maven for building and running the tests.
Maven 3.0+ is required.


Adding Features
---------------
In order to add a feature to gcloud-java:

The feature must be fully documented using Javadoc and examples should be provided.
The feature must work fully on Java 7 and above.
The feature must not add unnecessary dependencies (where "unnecessary" is of course subjective,
but new dependencies should be discussed).


Coding Style
------------
Maintain the coding style in the project and in particular the modified files.
Follow the Google Java [style](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html).
